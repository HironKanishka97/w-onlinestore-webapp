### Installation Guide
### 1\. **Clone the Repositories**

Start by cloning both the backend and frontend repositories to your local machine.

*    clone https://github.com/HironKanishka97/w-onlinestore-webapp.git
    
### 2\. **Set Up Backend (Spring Boot)**

1.  **Install Java **:Ensure that **Java ** is installed on your system. You can download it from [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
    
2.  **Configure Database (MySQL)**:
    
    *   propertiesCopy codespring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db_name
    *   spring.datasource.username=root
    *   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    *   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    *   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
        
3.   mvn clean install
    
4.   mvn spring-boot:runYour backend should now be running at http://localhost:8080.
    

### 3\. **Set Up Frontend (React)**

1.  **Install Node.js and npm**:Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    
2.  npm install 
    
3.  npm run dev = Your frontend should now be running at http://localhost:port_number.
    

### 4\. **JWT Authentication Setup**

1.  **Backend - Spring Security Configuration**:
    
    *   The backend is configured with **Spring Security** and **JWT** for user authentication and authorization. The /login endpoint is used to authenticate users and receive a JWT token.
        
    *   The backend includes a filter (JwtAuthenticationFilter) that intercepts requests and verifies the JWT token for protected routes.
        
2.  **Frontend - React Authentication**:
    
    *   In the frontend, the login form allows users to authenticate and receive a JWT token. The token is stored in **local storage** and sent with every request that requires authentication.
        
    *   The frontend includes an **HTTP interceptor** using axios to add the JWT token to the headers of the API requests.
