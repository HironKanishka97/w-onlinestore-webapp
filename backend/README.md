# Spring Boot Template with JWT Authentication

This is a Spring Boot project template that includes basic JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for securing APIs. It provides a foundation for creating secure applications with JWT authentication already set up, allowing developers to focus on building out their application logic. Role-based authentication is not implemented yet but can be added as needed.

## Features

- JWT authentication for securing endpoints.
- Spring Security configuration for protecting API routes.
- Easily customizable for any Spring Boot-based application.
- Provides authentication and token validation logic.
- Lightweight, making it an excellent starting point for any REST API project.
